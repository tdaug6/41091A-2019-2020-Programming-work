    <h2>Desctiption</h2>
    <p>
        Here you will find all of the functions that we created custom this year. 
        We have found all of these functions super helpful and we hope you do too.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>PIDLoop(speed, distance, direction, time)</h2>
    <p>
        This function is a PID controller for driving forward and backwards.  
        The parameters are the max speed (speed) measured in <b>percentage</b>, 
        distance to travel (distance) measured in <b>inches</b>, 
        the direction as a string statement of <b>“fwd” or “rev”</b> and time measured in <b>sec</b>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
      <h2>NonPIDLoop(speed, distance, direction, time, stopMotor)</h2>
      <p>
        This function does not use a PID controller for driving forward and backwards.  
        The parameters are the speed (speed) measured in percentage, 
        distance to travel (distance) measured in inches, 
        the direction as a string statement of “fwd” or “rev”, 
        time the function has measured in sec, 
        and the type of brake for the motors (stopMotor) as a string statement of “none” to have the motors keep running after the function
         and “yes” for a motor hold.
